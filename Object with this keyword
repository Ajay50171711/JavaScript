What is an Object in JavaScript?
An object in JavaScript is a collection of properties, where each property has a key (or name) and a value. Think of it as a way to store multiple related pieces of data together.

Keys are also called properties (e.g., name, age).
Values can be anything: strings, numbers, arrays, other objects, or even functions (methods).

// Step 1: Create an object
const student = {
  name: "Alex",        // Property 1
  age: 20,             // Property 2
 
  
  // Method: Function inside the object
  introduce: function() {
    console.log("Hello, my name is " + this.name + " and I am " + this.age + " years old.");
  }
};

// Step 2: Access properties
console.log(student.name); // Output: Alex
console.log(student.age);  // Output: 20

// Step 3: Call methods
student.introduce()



What is the this keyword?
The this keyword in JavaScript refers to the object that is currently executing the code. It helps you work with properties and methods inside an object or in a specific context.
